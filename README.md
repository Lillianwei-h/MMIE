We present **MMIE**, a **M**assive **M**ultimodal **I**nterleaved understanding **E**valuation benchmark, designed for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE provides a robust framework to assess the interleaved comprehension and generation capabilities of LVLMs across diverse domains, supported by reliable automated metrics.
<!-- 
### 🔑 Key Features

#### 🗂 Dataset
- **Comprehensive**: 20K+ examples in interleaved multimodal format, consolidated into one JSON file for easy access.
- **Diverse**: Spanning 12 fields and 102 subfields, offering broad and deep evaluation across domains.
- **Ground Truth Reference**: Each question comes paired with a reference, ensuring accurate evaluations of model performance.

#### ⚙️ Metric
- **Automated Scoring**: Evaluate your model’s results with our scoring model, [MMIE-Score](https://huggingface.co/MMIE/MMIE-Score), powered by **InternVL-2-4B**.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Fine-tuned to reduce bias and ensure objective evaluations.
- **Multimodal Capability**: Tailored for interleaved inputs and outputs, evaluating both text and image comprehension.
- **High Correlation with Human Scores**: Outperforms alternative metrics such as GPT-4o in multimodal tasks, ensuring reliable benchmarking results.

### 🗂 Dataset
MMIE evaluates LVLMs across interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation tasks. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure a wide range of examples across various fields, providing balanced coverage for comprehensive evaluations. These examples test reasoning, cognitive tasks, and multimodal alignment, ensuring detailed insights into model performance.

### ⚙️ Metric

#### 🔄 Evaluation Pipeline

</div>

The MMIE evaluation metric is built on **InternVL-2-4B**, a high-performing vision-language model fine-tuned for multimodal reasoning. This pipeline evaluates models using:
- **Text Quality**: Clarity, coherence, and grammar.
- **Image Quality**: Vividness and accuracy of image descriptions.
- **Text-Image Coherence**: How well visual descriptions support the narrative.
- **Stylistic Consistency**: Consistent style and structure throughout text and images.

#### 📊 Results

</div>

*Note: Higher values indicate better performance for Pearson and Cosine Similarity, while lower values are better for MSE and MAE.*

The MMIE evaluation metric achieves high correlations with human annotations in all aspects of multimodal comprehension and generation. It consistently outperforms other metrics, like GPT-4o, making it ideal for large-scale model benchmarking and comparison.

## 📚 Setup
We have host MMIE dataset on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMIE/MMIE), where you should request access on this page first and shall be automatically approved.
Please download all the files in this repository and unzip `images.tar.gz` to get all images. We also provide `overview.json`, which is an example of the format of our dataset.


## 📦 Model Evaluation
### Setup
#### Dataset Preparation
Your to-eval data format should be:
```
[
    {
        "id": "",
        "question": [
            {
                "text": "...",
                "image": LOCAL_PATH_TO_THE_IMAGE or null
            },
            ...
        ],
        "answer": [
            {
                "text": "...",
                "image": LOCAL_PATH_TO_THE_IMAGE or null
            },
            ...
        ],
        "model": "gt",
        "gt_answer": [
            {
                "text": "...",
                "image": LOCAL_PATH_TO_THE_IMAGE or null
            },
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```
Currently `gt_answer` is only used for Multi-step Reasoning tasks. But it is required in the data format. You can set `"gt_answer": [{"text": None,"image":None}]` for other tasks.

Make sure the file structure be:
```
INPUT_DIR
    |INPUT_FILE(data.json)
    |images
        |0.png
        |1.png
        |...
```

#### Installation
- Clone code from this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lillianwei-h/MMIE
cd MMIE
```
- Build environment
```bash
conda create -n MMIE python=3.11
conda activate MMIE
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash_attn
```

#### Model Preparation
You can download our [MMIE-Score](https://huggingface.co/MMIE/MMIE-Score) model on HuggingFace and refer to the document of [InternVL 2.0](https://internvl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internvl2.0/introduction.html) to find more details.

#### Run
```bash
python main.py --model_path PATH_TO_MMIE-Score --input_dir INPUT_DIR --input_file INPUT_FILE
```

The output file should be at `./eval_outputs/eval_result.json` by default. You can also use arguments `--output_dir` and `--output_file` to specify your intended output position.
